*The Advice Shop Website*

This is my personal fork of the example website, [The Advice Shop](https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/theadviceshop).

My task for this prac was to demonstrate:
* **Echo** - echoing different kinds of HTML
* **Decisions** - if/else statements
* **Repetition** - for, while, foreach (use an array)
* **Functions** - with parameters
* **Include** - Make two pages that include a common header and/or footer using `include`

First created for the 2015 class in Townsville, by [Lindsay Ward](https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/), as 
an Example Site for Web Design (CP1406, CP3402) at JCU.

Demonstrates a few useful things like:

- Navigation highlights the current page
- **SQLite** database integration (just read) for quotes
- List of quotes -> link to individual quotes
- Super-basic "login" form demonstrates PHP **sessions** 
- Login form processing page redirects (never shows in browser)
